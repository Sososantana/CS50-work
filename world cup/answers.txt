Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
certain teams winning percentages changed......

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I belive by 100,000 simulations all possibilities have been checked......
